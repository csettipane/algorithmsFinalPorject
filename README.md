Visualizing Sorting Algorithms
![alt test](pictures/screenshot)

For our final project, we wanted to help new learners of Computer Science visualize sorting algorithms and their run times. 
In this repository, you will find the Python files that generate an animated bar graph that sorts itself based on the algorithm used.
Open each file using Python IDLE and run the code to generate the visualization. 

You have the option to pick a random array, reversed array, rotated array or an almost sorted array. Just make sure to comment 
out the 3 you don't want.
